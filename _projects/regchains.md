__Regular chains__ are a powerful tool whose main application lies
in solving systems of polynomial equations, inequations,
and inequalities, symbolically. Loosely, regular chains
are triangular systems of polynomial equations with
desirable computational properties. The algebraic object associated
with the ideal of the vanishing set
of a regular chain is its saturated ideal (when saturated by any power of its initial).
Formal definitions of a regular chain, saturated ideal, and a description of their properties
and implementation in Maple can be found [here](https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/maple/view.aspx?path=RegularChains).

I have been developing commands in the
_AlgebraicGeometryTools_ sub-package of the _RegularChains_ library. In particular,
my work concerns the _IntersectionMultiplicity_, _TangentCone_, and _TriangularizeWithMultiplicity_
commands, where I have introduced new, underlying algorithms and improved the implementation
of previous algorithms.

The _ReguarChains_ library is available through [Maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/) or through the regular chains website [here](http://www.regularchains.org/).

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
