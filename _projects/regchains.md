__Regular chains__ are a powerful tool whose main application lies
in solving systems of polynomial equations, inequations,
and inequalities, symbolically. Loosely, regular chains
are triangular systems of polynomial equations with
desirable computational properties.
#The algebraic object associated
#with the ideal of the vanishing set
#of a regular chain is its saturated ideal (when saturated by any power of its initial).
A formal definition of a regular chain and a description of its properties
and implementation in Maple can be found [here](https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/maple/view.aspx?path=RegularChains).

I have been developing commands in the
_AlgebraicGeometryTools_ sub-package of the _RegularChains_ library. In particular,
my work concerns the _IntersectionMultiplicity_, _TangentCone_, and _TriangularizeWithMultiplicity_
commands, where I have introduced new, underlying algorithms and improved the implementation
of previous algorithms. A paper on this work and the resulting performance improvements,
is underway and will be made available shortly.
#For now, the corresponding slides can be found [here]()

Additionally, I have helped prepare materials on Regular Chains and their applications for the
[Advanced Problem Solving with Regular Chains](https://ryansandford.github.io/assets/pdf/RegularChains) tutorial given in the 2021 Maple conference.

The _ReguarChains_ library is available through [Maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/products/Maple/) or through the regular chains website [here](http://www.regularchains.org/).

    The LimitPoints command uses regular chains to compute the limit points of a space curve.
    Here the space curve (in green) is defined by the intersection of the red and blue surfaces,
    with limit points (0,0,0) and (0,1,0).

  The TangentCone command uses regular chains to compute the tangent cone of a space curve. The

    The TriangularizeWithMultiplicity command can be used to solve a system of polynomial equations
    and compute the intersection multiplicity at each solution. Above we display the polynomial system mth191, for which TriangularizeWithMultiplicity returns 8 solutions in the form of regular chains, and their corresponding
    intersection multiplicities.
