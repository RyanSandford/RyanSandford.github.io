The following poster summarizes some of the results from my research into generalizing Fulton's intersection multiplicity algorithm. 
The poster was presented in a joint lab meeting for the Ontario Research Centre for Computer Algebra [(ORCCA)](http://www.orcca.on.ca/). 
The pdf can be found on the ORCCA website [here](https://www.orcca.on.ca/presentations.html).
