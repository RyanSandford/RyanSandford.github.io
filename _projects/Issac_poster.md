A poster presented in [The International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation](https://www.issac-conference.org/2025/) (ISSAC) 2025 conference in Guanajuato, Mexico. The work provides meaningful upper and lower bounds for the time complexity of the generalization of Fulton's intersection multiplicity algorithm, and proposes an optimization to significantly improve performance and computational efficiency in the average case.
