I am a MSc student in computer science at the University of Western Ontario.
My research is supervised by Professor [Marc Moreno Maza](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~mmorenom/)
and conducted within the Ontario Research Centre for Computer Algebra [(ORCCA)](http://www.orcca.on.ca/).
I received a BSc in 2020, with an Honours Specialization in Mathematics and a Major in Computer Science,
at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.math.uwo.ca/).
