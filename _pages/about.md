### Education

I received my MSc in Computer Science from the University of Western Ontario in 2022, studying __Computer Algebra__.
My research was supervised by Professor [Marc Moreno Maza](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~mmorenom/)
and conducted within the Ontario Research Centre for Computer Algebra [(ORCCA)](http://www.orcca.on.ca/).

I also received a BSc in 2020, with an Honours Specialization in Mathematics and a Major in Computer Science,
at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.math.uwo.ca/).

### Research

My research focuses mainly on the computational aspects of mathematics.
Some of my interests include:

* Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation
* Computational Algebraic Geometry
* Formalization
* Homotopy Type Theory
